<p>The Drainage network ordering operation: </p>

<ul>

<li>examines all drainage lines in the drainage network map, i.e. an output map from the <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/drainage_network_extraction_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Drainage network extraction</a> operation, </li>

<li>finds the nodes where two or more streams meet, and </li>

<li>assigns a unique ID to each stream in between these nodes, as well as to the streams that only have a single node. </li>

</ul>

<p class="emptyline">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tiptext"><span class="tip">Tip: </span>When you used a high quality DEM, many superfluous streams may have come up with the Drainage network extraction operation. To limit the number of output streams and reduce calculation time for the Drainage network ordering operation, you can specify the minimum drainage length (in meters); then, only external streams with a length greater than this value will remain in the output drainage network. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">The output of this operation is a raster map, a segment map and an attribute table that all use a newly created ID domain. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">The attribute table contains information on each stream, such as: </p>

<ul>

<li>Strahler ordering number, Shreve ordering number, </li>

<li>stream length, calculated along the drainage, and calculated as a straight line between XY-coordinates, </li>

<li>slope values in degrees and in percentages, calculated along the drainage and calculated as a straight line between XY-coordinates, and elevation, </li>

<li>sinuosity of the drainage path as a measure of meandering, </li>

<li>total upstream drainage length, i.e. the total length of the streams that drain into the current one, etc.</li>

</ul>

<p class="defnewpar">The output maps and the attribute table of the Drainage network ordering operation are used as input 
in many other DEM-hydro processing operations, among others:</p>

<p class="kopje">Principles of Strahler and Shreve network ordering:</p>

<p>In the attribute table, a Strahler column and a Shreve column will be found. These columns contain values that reflect the position of a stream between its adjacent upstream and downstream streams. The ordering systems have a different manner of calculation. </p>

<p class="emptyline">&nbsp;</p>

<ul>

<li>First, the streams are found that form the upper-most starting points of the drainages in the network. These streams obtain ordering number 1 (both in the Strahler and in the Shreve ordering system), until a node is found that connects the stream with a following stream (down-flow). </li>

	<ul>

	<li class="linespacing03before">For next streams down-flow, <i>Strahler ordering numbers</i> are calculated as follows: 

		<ul>

		<li class="li01be">When two (or more) streams of equal order join each other, the stream order value is increased by 1. <br >
			For example, when two streams with order number 2 join each other, the next stream will receive order number 3. </li>

		<li class="li01be">When a higher-order stream joins a lower-order stream, the order number for the next stream does not increase; instead, the largest order number of the streams that contribute to it is assigned. <br>
			For example, when a stream with order number 1 joins a stream with order number 2, the next stream will also be assigned order number 2. </li>

		</ul>

	<li class="linespacing03before">For next streams down-flow, <i>Shreve ordering numbers</i> are calculated as: </li>

		<ul>
	
    		<li>the sum of the Shreve ordering numbers of the streams that directly contribute to this stream.<br>
			
			For example, when a stream with order number 1 joins a stream with order number 2, the next stream will be assigned order number 3. </li>

		</ul>
	
</ul>

<p class="defnewpar">Below, you will find two pictures explaining the Strahler and Shreve ordering systems. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">You can also read about both methods in the explanation of the columns of the attribute table below. </p>

<p class="kopje">Input map requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A raster map containing height values (DEM); </li>
<li>a raster map that is the outcome of a previous <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/flow_direction_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Flow direction</a> operation;</li>
<li>a raster map that is the outcome of a previous <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/drainage_network_extraction_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Drainage network extraction</a> operation.</li>
</ul>

<p class="defnewpar">Furthermore, you can specify a value called Minimum drainage length (in meters); segments with a length smaller than this value will not remain in the output maps. 
	By choosing a larger value, fewer streams will remain in the drainage network; this will speed up the operation. </p>

<p class="kopje">Domain of output maps and attribute table:</p>

<ul>
<li>A output raster map and an output segment map will be created; these maps will use a newly created ID domain. </li>
<li>The new ID domain will obtain the same name as the output raster map. </li>
<li>An output attribute table will be created, using the same ID domain. </li>
<li>The output raster map and the output segment map are both linked to the output attribute table. </li>
</ul>

<p class="defnewpar">Additionally, a new class domain and a class representation are created for the StrahlerClass column in the attribute table (see below). <br>
	The class domain and the class representation obtain the same name as the output ID domain followed by <span class="courier">__1</span>.</p>

<p class="tiptext">To obtain label points for the segments, you can perform the <a href="table_to_point_map_functionality_algorithm.htm">Table to point map</a> operation: </p>
<ul class="tipul">
<li>As input table, choose the output table of the Drainage network ordering operation, </li>

	<ul class="tipul">
	<li>you can simply use the table domain for the output map, </li>

		<ul>
		<li>first create another attribute (class) column in the table by using a tabcalc statement like: <span class="courier">MyClassCol = %k</span>, </li>
		<li>make sure you create a new Class domain in the <span class="arial"><a href="../ilwismen/column_properties.htm">Column Properties</a></span> dialog box; </li>
