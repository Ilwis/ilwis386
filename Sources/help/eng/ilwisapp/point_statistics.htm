<h1 class=only1>Point statistics</h1>

<!--<hr>-->

<p class=defnewpar>Point statistics may help to get an impression of the nature of your point data prior to for instance a point interpolation, and to find necessary input parameters for a <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/kriging_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Kriging</a> operation.</p>

<p class=defnewpar>For point statistics a point map is required in which:</p>

<ul>

<li>	the points themselves are values (point map with a value domain), for instance concentration values, or </li>

<li>	the points have an identifier (point map with a Class or ID domain) and values are stored in a column of the attribute table that is linked to the map.</li>

</ul>

<p>The output of the Spatial correlation, Cross Variogram and the Pattern analysis operations is a table. By displaying the output table, you can also display graphs, especially semi-variograms. The output of the Variogram surface operation is a plot-like raster map.</p>

<p class=kopje>Operations to calculate point statistics:</p>

<ul>

<li class=ls01be>	<a href="spatial_correlation.htm">Spatial correlation</a>: calculates spatial autocorrelation (as Moran's I), spatial variance (as Geary's c) and semi-variogram values <span class=symbol>g</span>(h) for point values that are at certain distances towards each other in a point map. </li>

        <p class=linespacing01before>	Regarding spatial autocorrelation and spatial variance is the user encouraged to compare his or her data set with a data set consisting of the same point locations, with a set of attribute values, approximately in the same range as the measured variable, but created at random (using one of the RND functions in Table Calculation). If the correlation/variance graphs are very much the same for the measured data and the random data, no autocorrelation exists between the data points. Hence, point interpolation is not useful.</p>

        <p class=linespacing01before>	By calculating semi-variogram values, you can display a semi-variogram. By modelling the semi-variogram, you can find the necessary input parameters, such as a model (spherical, exponential, etc.) and sill, range, and nugget values, for a <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/kriging_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Kriging</a> operation. </p>

<li class=ls01be>	<a href="variogram_surface.htm">Variogram surface</a>: calculates a surface of semi-variogram values where each cell (pixel) in the surface represents a directional distance class. The output surface, a raster map with a special kind of georeference, may help you to visualize possible anisotropy of your data and to determine the direction of the anisotropy axis. As input, you can use a point map or a raster map.</li>

        <p class=linespacing01before>	Subsequently, you can calculate directional semi-variograms by using the directional method in the <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/spatial_correlation_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Spatial correlation</a> operation. From the output table of Spatial correlation, you can prepare a semi-variogram model and investigate the range of the variable in the semi-variogram model both in the direction of anisotropy as well as in the direction perpendicular to it. Then, you are ready to perform <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/anisotropic_kriging_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Anisotropic Kriging</a>.</p>

<li class=ls01be>	<a href="cross_variogram.htm">Cross Variogram</a>: calculates experimental semi-variogram values for two variables and cross-variogram values for the combination of both variables. As input for the Cross Variogram operation, you can use a point map with a linked attribute table containing at least two value attribute columns. The Cross Variogram operation is a multivariate form of the <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/spatial_correlation_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Spatial correlation</a> operation. </li>

        <p class=linespacing01before>	From the output table of the Cross Variogram operation, you can create semi-variogram models for both variables and a cross-variogram model for the combination of the variables. All three models serve as input for the <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/cokriging_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >CoKriging</a> operation. CoKriging calculates estimates or predictions for a poorly sampled variable (the predictand) with help of a well-sampled variable (the covariable). The variables should be highly correlated (positive or negative).  </p>

<li class=ls01be>	<a href="pattern_analysis.htm">Pattern analysis</a>: a tool to obtain information on the spatial distribution of points in a point map. The output table contains six columns with the probabilities of finding 1 point (<span class=courier>Prob1Pnt</span>) within a certain distance from any point in your input map, then 2 points (<span class=courier>Prob2Pnt</span>), 3 points (<span class=courier>Prob3Pnt</span>), etc. Another column (<span class=courier>ProbAllPnt</span>) contains the sum of <span class=courier>Prob1Pnt</span>, <span class=courier>Prob2Pnt</span>, ..., <span class=courier>Prob(n-1)</span>, in which <i>n</i> is the number of points in the input map. </li>

        <p class=linespacing01before>	By inspecting the graphs of distances against probabilities, you may recognize distribution patterns of your points like random, clustered, regular, paired etc. </p>

</ul>
