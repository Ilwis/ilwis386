<p>Display three images, or other raster maps with a value domain, present in a map list as a <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/color_composite_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >color composite</a>. You will show an <a href="show_map_list_as_color_composite.htm">Interactive color composite</a>.</p>

<p class="defnewpar">By using an <i>interactive</i> color composite, you can easily change intervals, select other bands, etc. The resulting color composite is displayed in a map window which can be saved as a map view. Interactive color composites are very suitable to be used as a background during <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/sample_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >sampling</a> or during screen digitizing. <br>
Your graphics board needs to be configured to use more than 256 colors, for instance High Color 16-bit, or True Color 24-bit (see Display Settings in Windows' Control Panel).</p>

<p class="defnewpar">A <i>permanent</i> color composite can always be created with <span class=arial>Color Composite</span> operation on the <a href="../ilwis/main_window_menu_commands.htm">Operations, Image Processing</a> menu.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Show map list as slide show</p>

<p>Show multiple raster maps which are combined in a map list, one after the other in a map window at a user-specified rate. You will show a <a href="../ilwisapp/show_map_list_as_slide_show.htm">Slide Show</a>. This visualization technique is designed to present multi-temporal changes in maps. All maps in the map list must use the same domain and the same georeference.</p>

<p class="defnewpar">You can use a slide show:</p>

<ul>

<li>	to present the temporal changes in maps of the same theme but of different years,</li>

<li>	to display a number of classified satellite images of different months or years,</li>

<li>	to display derived products from satellite images such as NDVI maps of different months,</li>

<li>	to display a number of 3D views one after the other. </li>

</ul>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Display 3D</p>

<p>With <a href="display_3d.htm">Display 3D</a>, you can create and edit a georeference 3D in order to obtain a three dimensional view of one or more maps. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is required to create a georeference 3D. The DEM can then be displayed as 3D grid lines with or without a drape of a raster map. The georeference 3D can be edited with the Georeference 3D editor.</p>

<p class="defnewpar">When finished editing the 3D view, you can add point, segment and/or polygon maps and/or annotation to improve the 3D view.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Apply 3D</p>

<p>The <a href="apply_3d.htm">Apply 3D</a> operation resamples an input raster map according to a georeference 3D. This enables you to permanently and quickly display raster maps in three dimensions. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">You can create a georeference 3D with <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/display3d_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Display 3D</a> or Apply 3D; a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is required and you have to specify 3D view parameters using the Georeference 3D editor.</p>

<p class=emptyline>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=kopjeboldandund>RASTER OPERATIONS</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Map Calculation</p>

<p><a href="../ilwis/calc.htm">Map Calculation</a> can be used to perform calculations with raster maps. </p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Attribute map of raster map</p>

<p>By creating an <a href="attribute_map_of_raster_map.htm">attribute map of a raster map</a>, the class name or ID of each pixel in the original map is replaced by the value, class or ID found in a certain column in an attribute table. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">A raster map using a Class or ID domain, can have extra attribute information on the classes or identifiers in the map. These attributes are stored in columns in an attribute table. The attribute table can be linked to the map to which it refers, or to the domain of the map. You can check whether an attribute table is linked to the raster map or to its domain through the <a href="..//ilwis/popup/object_properties_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Properties</a> dialog box of the map or the domain. </p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Cross</p>

<p>The <a href="cross.htm">Cross</a> operation performs an overlay of two raster maps. Pixels on the same positions in both maps are compared; the occurring combinations of class names, identifiers or values of pixels in the first input map and those of pixels in the second input map are stored. These combinations give an output cross map and a cross table. The cross table includes the combinations of input values, classes or IDs, the number of pixels that occur for each combination and the area for each combination.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Aggregate map</p>

<p>The <a href="aggregate.htm">Aggregate map</a> operation aggregates blocks of input pixels by applying an aggregation function: Average, Count, Maximum, Median, Minimum, Predominant, Standard Deviation or Sum. The Aggregate Map operation either creates a new georeference in which each block of input pixels corresponds to one output pixel (group) or the output raster map uses the same georeference as the input map (no group).</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Distance calculation</p>

<p><a href="distance_calculation.htm">Distance calculation</a> assigns to each pixel the smallest distance in meters towards user-specified source pixels, for example to schools, to roads etc. The output is called a <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/distance_calculation_distance_map_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >distance map</a>. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">The input map for a distance calculation is called a <b>source map</b>: all pixels with a class name, ID, or value are regarded as source pixels, and distance values will be calculated for all pixels that are undefined. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">Inaccessible or less accessible areas can be indicated in a <b>weight map</b>. The weight factors in such a map represent the relative difficulty, a 'resistance', to surpass pixels. By using weight factors that are inversely proportional to the possible speed that can be obtained in different mapping units, a so-called <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/distance_calculation_time_travel_map_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >time travel map</a> can be calculated.</p>

<p class="defnewpar">Through a distance calculation, also a <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/distance_calculation_thiessen_map_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Thiessen map</a> can be calculated. A weight map can be used, but is not obligatory.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Iterations</p>

<p><a href="iteration.htm">Iterations</a> are a special type of map calculations. They are a successive repetition of a mathematical operation, using the result of one calculation as input for the next. These calculations are performed line by line, pixel by pixel and take place in all directions. When a calculation in one direction is finished (for instance from top to bottom) a rotation takes place for the calculation in the next direction. The calculation stops when there are no more differences between an output map compared to the previous output map, or when a certain number of iterations is reached as defined before. Iterations are often used in combination with neighbourhood operations.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Area numbering</p>

<p><a href="areanumbering.htm">Area numbering</a> is a raster operation which assigns unique identifiers to pixels with the same class names or values that are horizontally, vertically or diagonally connected. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">The output of Area numbering is a map in which these connected areas are codified as Area 1, Area 2, etc. Furthermore, an attribute table is created for the output map. The table contains the new IDs; the class names, IDs, or values of the original mapping units; and the size (npix and area) of the unique output units. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">Area numbering can be used to make a decision based on the size of individual groups of pixels with the same class name or value (uniquely identified areas) instead of on all pixels with the same class name or value.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Sub-map of raster map</p>

<p>The <a href="submap_of_raster_map.htm">Sub-map of raster map</a> operation copies a rectangular part of a raster map into a new raster map. The user has to specify row and column numbers or XY-coordinates of the input map to indicate the part of the input map that should be copied into the new raster map.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Glue raster maps</p>

<p>The <a href="glue_raster_maps.htm">Glue raster maps</a> operation glues or merges two or more georeferenced input raster maps into one output raster map. The output map then comprises the total area of all input maps. The domains of the input maps are merged when needed. A resampling is performed when needed.</p>

<p class="defnewpar">With the Glue raster maps operation, you can thus merge two or more adjacent or partly overlapping raster maps (i.e. make a mosaic), or glue smaller raster maps onto a larger one. </p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Mirror/Rotate</p>

<p>The <a href="mirror_rotate.htm">Mirror/Rotate</a> operation allows you to reflect a raster map in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line, to transpose the map's rows and columns, or to rotate a raster map 90°, 180°, 270° (clock-wise).</p>

<p class="defnewpar">In ILWIS, the word 'mirror' is used as a synonym for 'reflection'.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation (SMCE)</p>

<p><a href="../ilwis/smce_window.htm">Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation (SMCE)</a> is an application that assists and guides a user in doing Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) in a spatial way.</p> 

<p class="defnewpar">As input for the application, you need to build a <a href="..//ilwis/popup/objects_criteria_trees_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >criteria tree</a>: </p>

<ol>

	<li>specify a main goal and supply a name for the final output map, </li>

	<li>optionally, add groups to the main goal; a group is supposed to contain multiple factors, </li>

	<li>add criteria to the main goal, and specify whether a criterion is a factor or a constraint. </li>

</ol>

<p class="defnewpar">For each factor and for each constraint, you need to specify a name as text (like a description), and an input map or input attribute column. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">A criteria tree lists and defines: 

<ul>

<li>all inserted groups, factors and constraints, </li>

<li>the way in which all groups, factors and constraints should be grouped, standardized and weighed, </li>

<li>in order to calculate the final output map. </li>

</ul>

<p class="defnewpar">The output of the operation is a so-called 'composite index' raster map. This map combines all input data according to the rules for weighing and standardization of the factors and/or constraints. The output map shows the suitability for the goal that was set, and can be an aid in planning and decision-making.</p>

<p class=emptyline>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=kopjeboldandund>IMAGE PROCESSING</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Filter</p>

<p><a href="filter.htm">Filtering</a> is a raster operation in which each pixel value in a raster map is replaced with a new value. </p>

<p>The new value is obtained by applying a certain function to each input pixel and its direct neighbours. These neighbours are usually the 8 adjacent pixels (in a 3 x 3 filter) or the 24 surrounding pixels (in a 5 x 5 filter). When you create or define your own filters, any odd sized matrix is allowed (5 x 1, 11 x 23, 25 x 25). </p>

<p class="defnewpar">Filtering is for instance used to sharpen a satellite image, to detect line features, etc. </p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Stretch</p>

<p>The <a href="stretch_functionality.htm">Stretch</a> operation re-distributes values of an input map over a wider or narrower range of values in an output map. Stretching can for instance be used to enhance the contrast in your map when it is displayed. Two stretch methods are available: linear stretching and histogram equalization.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Slicing</p>

<p>The <a href="slicing.htm">Slicing</a> operation classifies ranges of values of an input raster map into classes of an output map. A domain Group should be created beforehand; it lists the upper value boundaries of the groups and the output class names. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">To perform an interactive slicing, you can create a representation value for the input map and change value boundaries and colors of the representation value.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Color separation</p>

<p>The <a href="color_separation.htm">Color separation</a> operation allows you to extract different 'bands' for instance from a scanned or digital color photo as if using color filters when taking the picture. After color extraction, you can perform the normal Image Processing operations like Filtering, Classification, etc. on these bands.</p>

<p class="defnewpar">Maps that have a Picture domain or the (24 bit) <span class=courier>Color</span> domain store for each pixel three values: Red, Green and Blue. The Color separation operation allows you to retrieve for each pixel either the Red, Green or Blue value and store these in a separate map. You can also retrieve Yellow, Magenta, Cyan, combined Gray values, or Hue, Saturation or Intensity values for each pixel.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Color composite</p>

<p>A color composite is a combination of three raster bands. One band is displayed in shades of red, one in shades of green and one in shades of blue. Putting three bands together in one color composite map can give a better visual impression of the reality on the ground, than by displaying one band at a time. Examples of color composites are false color (or IR) images and 'natural color' images. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">The <a href="color_composite.htm">Color Composite</a> operation on the <a href="../ilwis/main_window_menu_commands.htm">Operations, Image Processing</a> menu creates a <i>permanent</i> color composite raster map. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">To <i>interactively</i> display a map list as a color composite (16 or 24-bit), choose <span class=arial>Show MapList as Color Composite</span> from the <a href="../ilwis/main_window_menu_commands.htm">Operations, Visualization</a> menu. Interactive color composites can be stored by saving the map window as a map view.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Cluster</p>

<p><a href="cluster.htm">Clustering</a>, or unsupervised classification, is a rather quick process in which image data is grouped into spectral clusters based on the statistical properties of all pixel values. It is an automated classification approach with a maximum of 4 input bands.</p>

<p class="defnewpar">Optionally, an attribute table can be created for the output map. The table will contain statistical information on the output clusters: the average, predominant and minimum and maximum value of each cluster as found in the input bands. </p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Sample</p>

<p><a href="sample.htm">Sample</a> is an interactive process of selecting training pixels in a <a href="..//ilwis/popup/objects_sample_set_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >sample set</a> prior to an image classification. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">In the <a href="../ilwis/sample_set_editor_functionality1.htm">sample set editor</a>, select pixels that are characteristic for a certain type of a certain natural resource on the ground and that have similar spectral values in the maps in the map list, and assign a <b>class name</b> to them. The spectral values of these sampled pixels or training pixels provide the basis on which decisions are made during classification. These values can be inspected in the sample statistics of a certain class of training pixels and can be visualized in feature spaces. The result of Sampling is a filled sample set. </p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Classify</p>

<p>The <a href="classify.htm">Classify</a> operation performs a <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/classify_multispectral_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >multi-spectral</a> image classification according to training pixels in a <a href="..//ilwis/popup/objects_sample_set_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >sample set</a>.</p>

<p class="defnewpar">The following classification methods can be used: </p>

<ul>

<li>	Box classifier, </li>

<li>	Minimum distance, </li>

<li>	Minimum Mahalanobis distance, </li>

<li>	Maximum Likelihood, </li>

<li>    Maximum Likelihood including Prior Probabilities.</li>

</ul>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Resample</p>

<p>The <a href="resample.htm">Resample</a> operation resamples a raster map from the map's current <a href="..//ilwis/popup/objects_georeference_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >georeference</a> to another target georeference. The coordinate of each output pixel is used to calculate a new value from close-by pixel values in the input map. Three resampling methods are available: nearest neighbour, bilinear interpolation, and bicubic interpolation. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">In raster operations (e.g. <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/map_calculate_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >MapCalc</a>, <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/cross_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Cross</a>), all input raster maps must have the same georeference. Thus, prior to such operations, use Resample:</p>

<ul>

<li>	<i>to combine raster maps from various sources</i>, when maps use different coordinate systems (projections) or different georeferences (pixel size): resample the maps to one common georeference; </li>

<li>	<i>to combine satellite imagery of different dates or resolutions</i>: create a georef tiepoints for each set of images, then resample the images preferably to a georef corners;</li>

<li>	<i>to combine satellite images with rasterized vector maps</i>: rasterize the vector data on the georef tiepoints of the satellite images, or, in case you prefer North-oriented raster maps, rasterize the vector maps with a georef corners, and resample the images with the georef tiepoints to this georef corners;</li>

<li>	<i>to combine scanned photographs with rasterized vector data</i>, or <i>to rectify scanned aerial photographs</i>: create a georef tiepoints, a georef direct linear or a georef orthophoto for the photo, then resample the photo to a georef corners.</li>

</ul>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Epipolar stereo pair</p>

<p>With the <a href="epipolar_stereopair.htm">Epipolar Stereo Pair</a> operation, you will create a <a href="..//ilwis/popup/objects_stereopair_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >stereo pair</a> from two scanned aerial photographs with overlap. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">In short, the process is as follows: </p>

<ul>

<li>Specify the left input map and the right input map; one of the maps may already have a georeference. </li>

<li>Specify the output name of the stereo pair that will be created. </li>

</ul>

<p class="defnewpar">Then, in the <a href="../ilwis/epipolar_stereopair_creation_window.htm">Epipolar Stereo Pair - Creation window</a>: </p>

<ul>

<li>Mark on each photograph two, three, or four fiducial marks. </li>

<li>Mark the calculated principal point of the left photograph, on the right photograph (transferred principal point). </li>

<li>Mark the principal point of the right photograph, on the left photograph (transferred principal point). </li>

<li>In case of large scale differences between the two input maps, specify one or two scaling points in both photographs. </li>

</ul>

<p class="defnewpar">When you close the Epipolar Stereo Pair - Creation window, both input photographs will be resampled to output maps, i.e. the stereo pair is calculated. Rotation differences and possible scale differences between the photographs will be removed. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">A calculated stereo pair can be viewed: </p> 

<ul>

        <li>in a <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/stereoscope_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >stereoscope</a> window, while using a stereoscope, and </li>

        <li>as an <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/anaglyph_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >anaglyph</a> in a map window, while using red-green or red-blue glasses. </li>

</ul>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Stereo pair from DTM</p>

<p>The <a href="../ilwisapp/stereopair_from_dtm.htm">Stereo pair from DTM</a> operation creates a <a href="..//ilwis/popup/objects_stereopair_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >stereo pair</a> from an input photograph or image and a Digital Terrain Model (DTM). </p>

<p class="defnewpar">In the output stereo pair, the input photograph or image is displayed over the terrain. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">The result can be viewed in stereo, either: <p>

<ul>

<li>in a <a href="../ilwis/stereopair_stereoscope_window.htm">Stereo Pair - Stereoscope</a> window: use a stereoscope that is mounted onto your monitor, </li>

<li>as an <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/anaglyph_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Anaglyph</a> in a map window: use red-green or red-blue glasses. </li>

</ul> 

<p class=emptyline>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=kopjeboldandund>STATISTICS</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Histogram</p>

<p>The <a href="histogram.htm">Histogram</a> operation calculates the histogram of a raster, polygon, segment or point map. Histograms list frequency information on the values, classes, or IDs in your map. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">Results are shown in a histogram window as a table and as a graph. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">Histograms of Value raster maps also contain summary information such as mean, standard deviation, and percentage intervals. Summary information is available in a histogram window as well as in the <a href="..//ilwis/popup/object_properties_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Properties</a> of the histogram. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">A <b>raster histogram</b> lists the number of pixels, the percentages and the areas per value, class or ID. If the input raster map uses a Value domain, also cumulative number of pixels and cumulative percentages are calculated.</p>

<p>A <b>polygon histogram</b> lists the number of polygons and the perimeter and area of polygons per class, ID, or value. If the input polygon map uses a Value domain, also the cumulative number of polygons, cumulative perimeters and cumulative areas are calculated. </p>

<p>A <b>segment histogram</b> lists the number of segments and their length per class, ID or value. If the input segment map uses a Value domain, also the cumulative number of segments and cumulative lengths are calculated. </p>

<p>A <b>point histogram</b> lists the number of points per class, ID or value. If the input point map uses a Value domain, also the cumulative number of points are calculated. </p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Raster:</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappe2>Autocorrelation - Semivariance</p>

<p>The <a href="auto_correlation_semivariance.htm">Autocorrelation - Semivariance</a> operation calculates the autocorrelation and semivariance of a raster map. The autocorrelation of a raster map is generated by calculating the correlation between pixel values of a raster map and pixel values of the same raster map for different shifts (lags) in horizontal and vertical directions. The semivariance, a measure for the spatial variability of a raster map, is calculated for the same shifts. </p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Variogram Surface</p>

<p>The <a href="variogram_surface.htm">Variogram surface</a> operation uses a point map or a raster map as input and calculates a surface of semi-variogram values where each cell (pixel) in the surface represents a directional distance class. The output surface, a raster map with a special kind of georeference, may help you to visualize possible anisotropy of your data and to determine the direction of the anisotropy axis.</p>

<p class="defnewpar">Subsequently, you can calculate directional semi-variograms by using the directional method in the <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/spatial_correlation_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Spatial correlation</a> operation. From the output table of Spatial correlation, you can prepare a semi-variogram model and you can investigate the range of the variable in the semi-variogram model both in the direction of anisotropy as well as in the direction perpendicular to it. Then, you are ready to perform <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/anisotropic_kriging_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Anisotropic Kriging</a>.</p>

<p><a href="principal_component_analysis.htm">Principal Components Analysis</a> is mathematical method to uncover relationships among many variables (as found in a set of raster maps in a map list) and to reduce the amount of data needed to define the relationships. With Principal Component Analysis each variable is transformed into a linear combination of orthogonal common components (output raster maps) with decreasing variation. The linear transformation assumes the components will explain all of the variance in each variable. Hence each component (output raster map) carries different information which is uncorrelated with other components. </p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Factor Analysis</p>

<p><a href="factor_analysis.htm">Factor analysis</a> is used to uncover relationships among many variables (as found in a set of raster maps in a map list) and to reduce the amount of data needed to define the relationships. With Factor analysis each variable is transformed into a linear combination of orthogonal common factors (output raster maps) with decreasing variation. The linear transformation assumes the factors will explain all of the correlation in each variable. Hence each factor (output raster map) carries different information which is uncorrelated with other factors. </p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Variance-covariance matrix</p>

<p>The <a href="variance_covariance_matrix.htm">Variance-covariance matrix</a> operation calculates variances and covariances of raster maps in a map list. The variance is a means to express the variation of pixel values within a single raster map, i.e. a measure of the variation to the mean of the DN (Digital Number) values in a raster map. The covariance is a measure to express the variation of pixel values in two raster maps. It denotes the joint variation to the common mean of pixel values of the maps. Furthermore, the mean and standard deviation of each individual raster map is calculated. </p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Correlation matrix</p>

<p>The <a href="correlation_matrix.htm">Correlation matrix</a> operation calculates correlation coefficients of input raster maps of a map list. Correlation coefficients characterize the distribution of pixel values in two raster maps.  Furthermore, the mean and standard deviation of each individual raster map is calculated. </p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Polygons:</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappe2>Neighbour polygons</p>

<p>The <a href="neighbour_polygons.htm">Neighbour polygons</a> operation finds adjacent (or neighbouring) polygons in a polygon map and calculates the length of the boundaries of adjacent polygons.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Segments:</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappe2>Segment direction histogram</p>

<p>The <a href="segment_direction_histogram.htm">Segment direction histogram</a> operation calculates the total length and number of segments per direction. The output is a table with directions from 0 to 179° and the length and number of the segments in that direction. The results can be displayed as a rose-diagram.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Points:</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappe2>Spatial correlation</p>

<p><a href="spatial_correlation.htm">Spatial correlation</a> calculates some <a href="point_statistics.htm">point statistics</a>: spatial autocorrelation (as Moran's I), spatial variance (as Geary's c) and experimental semi-variogram values. Experimental semi-variogram values are either calculculated in all directions (omnidirectional) or in a certain direction and the perpendicular direction (bidirectional). This may help to get an impression of the nature of your point data, for instance prior to a <a href="point_interpolation.htm">point interpolation</a>. Furthermore, from the output table of the Spatial Correlation operation, you can create semi-variogram models in a graph window so that necessary input parameters for a <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/kriging_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Kriging</a>, <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/anisotropic_kriging_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Anisotropic Kriging</a> or <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/universal_kriging_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Universal Kriging</a> operation can be determined.</p>

<p class="defnewpar">As input for this operation, you can use a point map with a value domain, or a point map with a class or ID domain with an attribute table that contains one or more value columns (the attribute table must be linked to the map). The output of this operation is a table from which you can create graphs such as a semi-variogram.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Variogram Surface</p>

<p>The <a href="variogram_surface.htm">Variogram surface</a> operation uses a point map or a raster map as input and calculates a surface of semi-variogram values where each cell (pixel) in the surface represents a directional distance class. The output surface, a raster map with a special kind of georeference, may help you to visualize possible anisotropy of your data and to determine the direction of the anisotropy axis.</p>

<p class="defnewpar">Subsequently, you can calculate directional semi-variograms by using the directional method in the <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/spatial_correlation_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Spatial correlation</a> operation. From the output table of Spatial correlation, you can prepare a semi-variogram model and you can investigate the range of the variable in the semi-variogram model both in the direction of anisotropy as well as in the direction perpendicular to it. Then, you are ready to perform <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/anisotropic_kriging_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Anisotropic Kriging</a>.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Cross Variogram</p>

<p>The <a href="cross_variogram.htm">Cross Variogram</a> operation calculates experimental semi-variogram values for two variables and cross-variogram values for the combination of both variables. As input for the Cross Variogram operation, you can use a point map with a linked attribute table containing at least two value attribute columns. The Cross Variogram operation is a multivariate form of the <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/spatial_correlation_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Spatial correlation</a> operation. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">From the output table of the Cross Variogram operation, you can create semi-variogram models for both variables and a cross-variogram model for the combination of the variables (<a href="../ilwismen/graph_window_add_semivariogram_model.htm">Graph window : Add semivariogram model</a>). All three models serve as input for the <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/cokriging_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >CoKriging</a> operation. CoKriging calculates estimates or predictions for a poorly sampled variable (the predictand) with help of a well-sampled variable (the covariable). The variables should be highly correlated (positive or negative).  </p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Pattern analysis</p>

<p>The <a href="pattern_analysis.htm">Pattern analysis</a> operation is a tool to obtain information on the spatial distribution of points in a point map. The output table contains six columns with the probabilities of finding 1 point (<span class=courier>Prob1Pnt</span>) within a certain distance from any point in your input map, then 2 points (<span class=courier>Prob2Pnt</span>), 3 points (<span class=courier>Prob3Pnt</span>), etc. Another column (<span class=courier>ProbAllPnt</span>) contains the sum of <span class=courier>Prob1Pnt</span>, <span class=courier>Prob2Pnt</span>, ..., <span class=courier>Prob(n-1)</span>, where <span class=courier>n</span> is the number of points in the input map.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Raster:</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappe2>Densify raster map</p>

<p>The <a href="densify.htm">Densify raster map</a> operation reduces the pixel size of your map. The number of rows and columns is increased and the new pixels in between the existing ones are assigned a value by means of a bilinear or bicubic interpolation.</p>

<p class="defnewpar">You should use densify after a <a href="point_interpolation.htm">point interpolation</a>. Further, densify can be used to improve the quality of printed raster maps. </p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Raster:</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappe2>Kriging from raster</p>

<p><a href="kriging_from_raster.htm">Kriging from Raster</a> is similar to the Ordinary Kriging interpolation c.q. prediction method but requires a raster map
as input, instead of a point map. The operation can be seen as a raster interpolation
and returns a raster map with estimations and optionally an error map. The estimations are weighted averaged input point values, similar to the <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/moving_average_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Moving Average</a> operation. The weight factors in Kriging
from Raster are determined by using a user-specified semi-variogram model (based on the output of the
<a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/autocorrelation_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Autocorrelation -
Semivariance</a> operation), the distribution of input pixels, and are calculated in such a way that they minimize the estimation error in each output pixel. The estimated or predicted values are thus a linear combination of the input values and have a minimum estimation error. The optional error map contains the standard errors of the estimates.</p>

<p class="defnewpar">If you have an input point map, you can use the <a href="point_interpolation.htm">point interpolation</a> operations <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/kriging_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Simple and Ordinary Kriging</a>, <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/anisotropic_kriging_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Anisotropic Kriging</a>, <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/universal_kriging_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Universal Kriging</a> and <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/cokriging_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >CoKriging</a>.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappe2>Contour interpolation</p>

<p><a href="contour_interpolation.htm">Contour interpolation</a> is an operation which first rasterizes segments in a segment map with a value domain, and then calculates values for pixels that are not covered by segments by means of a linear interpolation. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">When using Contour interpolation on a segment map containing height (contour) information, the resulting raster map is a Digital Elevation Model.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Points:</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappe2>Point interpolation</p>

<p>In a <a href="point_interpolation.htm">point interpolation</a>, the input map is a point map, and the output map is a raster map. The pixel values in the raster output map are interpolated from the point values.</p>

<p class="defnewpar">There are four point interpolations: Nearest point, Moving average, Trend surface and Moving surface. For more information, see below.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Nearest point   (Point interpolation)</p>

<p>The <a href="nearest_point.htm">Nearest point</a> operation requires a point map as input and returns a raster map as output. Each pixel in the output map is assigned the class name, identifier, or value of the nearest point, according to Euclidean distance. This method is also called Nearest Neighbour or Thiessen. The points in the input point map for the Nearest point operation do not need to be values necessarily; point maps (or attribute columns) with a class, ID or bool domain are also accepted.</p>

<p class="defnewpar">For example schools, hospitals, water wells, etc. can be represented by points. The output map of a nearest point operation on such a point map gives the 'service area' of the schools, hospitals or water wells, based on the shortest distance (as the crow flies) between points and pixels.</p>

<p class="defnewpar">When you have many points or when you want to use weights to indicate accessibilities, it is advised to rasterize the points, and then use <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/distance_calculation_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Distance calculation</a> to make a Thiessen map.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Moving average    (Point interpolation)</p>

<p>The <a href="moving_average.htm">Moving average</a> operation is a <a href="point_interpolation.htm">point interpolation</a> which requires a point map as input and returns a raster map as output. To the output pixels, weighted averaged point values are assigned. The weight factors for the points are calculated by a user-specified weight function. The weight function ensures that points close to an output pixel obtain larger weights than points which are farther away. Furthermore, the weight functions are implemented in such a way that points which are farther away from an output pixel than a user-defined <a href="..//ilwisapp/sec/point_interpolation_limiting_distance_sec.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >limiting distance</a> obtain weight zero. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">When interpolating point values, it is for time efficiency reasons, strongly advised to choose a rather large pixel size for the output map. Further interpolation on the raster map values can be performed using the <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/densify_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Densify</a> operation or the <a href="..//ilwisapp/popup/resample_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Resample</a> operation.</p>

<p class=popuptitleinappen>Moving surface      (Point interpolation)</p>

<p>The <a href="moving_surface.htm">Moving surface</a> operation is a <a href="point_interpolation.htm">point interpolation</a> which requires a point map as input and returns a raster map as output.

<p class="popuptitleinappen">Cumulative hypsometric curve</p>

<p class="defnewpar">The <a href="../ilwisapp/cumulative_hypsometric_curve.htm">Cumulative hypsometric curve</a> script crosses a merged catchments map with your DEM. The script will ask for the ID of a single catchment that you wish to use in the Cross. In the resulting cross table, cumulative values are calculated for the Area of subsequent height values in square kilometers and in percentages. The output is stored in columns: <span class="courier">cum_area</span> and <span class="courier">cum_percent</span>. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">With the output cross table and its newly calculated columns, you can create graphs: </p>

<ul>

<li>use column <span class="courier">cum_area</span> or column <span class="courier">cum_percent</span> on the X-axis, </li>

<li>use the column with the height values on the Y-axis.</li>

</ul>

<p>This will give you a so-called cumulative hypsometric curve. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">As input, this script requires: </p>

<ul>

<li>an output map of a previous Catchment Merge operation, and the ID of a catchment in this map, </li>
