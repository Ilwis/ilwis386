<p class=popuptitle>Drainage Network Ordering</p>

<p>The <a href="..//ilwisapp/drainage_network_ordering.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Drainage Network Ordering</a> operation: </p>

<ul>

<li>examines all drainage lines in the drainage network map, i.e. output map from the Drainage Network Extraction operation, </li>

<li>finds the nodes where two or more streams meet, and </li>

<li>assigns a unique ID to each stream in between these nodes, as well as to the streams that only have a single node. </li>

</ul>

<p class="defnewpar">To limit the number of output streams and reduce calculation time, you can specify the minimum length that streams should have to remain in the network. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">The output of this operation is a raster map, a segment map and an attribute table that all use a newly created ID domain. </p>

<p class="defnewpar">The attribute table contains information on each stream, such as: </p>

<ul>

<li>Strahler ordering number, Shreve ordering number, </li>

<li>stream length, calculated along the drainage, and calculated as a straight line between XY-coordinates, </li>

<li>slope values in degrees and in percentages, calculated along the drainage and calculated as a straight line between XY-coordinates, and elevation, </li>

<li>sinuosity of the drainage path as a measure of meandering, </li>

<li>total upstream drainage length, i.e. the total length of the streams that drain into the current one, etc.</li>

</ul>
