<!--<hr>-->

<p class=defnewpar>The Main window contains:</p>

<ul>

<li class=linespacing01before>	<a href="main_window_menu_commands.htm">Menu bar</a>: the Main window has six menus: File, Edit, Operations, View, Window, and Help.</li>

<li class=linespacing01before>	<a href="main_window_catalog.htm">Catalog(s)</a>: the right central part of the Main window may show one or more Catalogs. A Catalog may provide an overview of available <a href="..//ilwis/sec/ilwis_objects_sec.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >ILWIS objects</a> in the current directory; opened <a href="..//ilwis/popup/objects_map_list_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >map lists</a> and opened <a href="..//ilwis/popup/objects_objcol_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >object collections</a> are also shown as a Catalog. <br> 
        
        When you double-click an object, the object will generally be opened. When you click an object with the right mouse button, you can choose to start an application with the selected object as input. </li>

<li class=linespacing01before>	<a href="main_window_operation_list.htm">Operation-tree and Operation-list</a>: located on the first two tabs in the Operations/Navigator pane, by default along the left hand side of the Main window. The Operation-tree and the Operation-list provide an overview of ILWIS operations. Operations are preceded by an icon of the output object of that operation. <br>

        You can start an operation by double-clicking an operation in the Operation-tree or the Operation-list, or by dragging an ILWIS object from the Catalog to the operation in the Operation-tree or the Operation-list to start the operation with that object. Of course, you can also start operations by selecting one from the Operations menu.</li>

<li class=linespacing01before>	The <a href="main_window_navigator.htm">Navigator</a> is found on the third tab in the Operations/Navigator pane, by default along the left hand side of the Main window. <br> 

        When you click a drive or directory in the Navigator, the contents of the selected directory will be shown in the currently active Catalog. <br> 

        You can use the History of the Navigator to return to previously used directories. </li>

<li class=linespacing01before>	<a href="main_window_standard_toolbar.htm">Standard toolbar</a>: by default located just below the menu bar. <br> 

        This toolbar provides short cuts for some regularly used menu commands.</li>

<li class=linespacing01before>	<a href="main_window_object_selection_toolbar.htm">Object selection toolbar</a>: by default located just below the standard toolbar. <br> 

        With this toolbar you can select the type of objects that should be shown in a Catalog. </li>

<li class=linespacing01before>	<a href="main_window_command_line.htm">Command line</a>: by default located just below the toolbars. <br>

        The command line can be used to type commands and expressions to perform map calculations, operations, and series of calculations and/or operations described in user-written scripts. <br>

        You can use the History of the command line to retrieve previously used commands and expressions. </li>

<li class=linespacing01before>	<a href="main_window_status_bar.htm">Status bar</a>: located at the bottom of the Main window. <br>

        The status bar gives short explanations on highlighted menu commands, descriptions on the functionality of buttons in the standard toolbar, descriptions of the operations in the Operation-tree and the Operation-list, descriptions of objects in the Catalog and whether objects are dependent, calculated and/or up-to-date, and the query used in the active Catalog. </li>

</ul>

<p class=defnewpar>The Main window can be sized by dragging its borders. For information on minimizing, maximizing the Main window, using scroll bars, using menus, etc., see the <a href="windows_features_introduction.htm">Introduction on Windows features</a> topic.</p>
