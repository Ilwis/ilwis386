<h1 class=secondline>Functionality</h1>

<!--<hr>-->

<p class=defnewpar>The segment editor is used to create and/or edit a <a href="..//ilwis/popup/objects_segment_map_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >segment map</a>. Furthermore, you can create a <a href="..//ilwis/popup/objects_polygon_map_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >polygon map</a>, by first digitizing segments with the segment editor, and then polygonizing the segments in the segment editor into a polygon map. For more information on creating a polygon map, see also <a href="how_to_create_polygon_maps.htm">How to create polygon maps</a>. </p>

<p class=defnewpar>With the segment editor, you can: </p>

<ul>

<li>	insert new segments and delete existing segments;</li>

<li>	edit the class name, ID or value of existing segments;</li>

<li>	change the position of intermediate coordinates within a segment;</li>

<li>	insert new nodes with segments (split) or merge two segment with the same code into a new segment;</li>

<li>	check segments and polygonize segments.</li>

</ul>

<p>Additionally, you can copy and paste segments to and from the clipboard, and you can pack, check and polygonize segments. </p>

<p class=defnewpar>The segment editor has a <a href="segment_editor_menu_commands.htm">menu bar</a>, a context-sensitive menu, and a <a href="segment_editor_toolbar.htm">toolbar</a>. </p>

<p class=defnewpar>You can create and edit segments with the <a href="#segedmouse"><span class=bookmark>mouse</span></a> on the screen, but you can also use a <a href="#segeddigitizer"><span class=bookmark>digitizer</a></span> when a map is fixed onto your digitizer tablet. </p>

<ul>

<li>When you wish to use the mouse, the segment editor has a Select mode, a Move Points mode, an Insert mode, and a Split/Merge mode. </li>

<li>When you wish to use a digitizer for the first time, you may have to setup the digitizer, reference the map on the digitizer, and/or make the digitizer active. For more information, see below. </li>

<p>When digitizer is active, a digitizer menu (see Figure 1 below) with the digitizer commands appears. <!--For a flowchart of the different digitizer menus, see Appendix : Flow charts of digitizer menus.--> </p>

</ul>

<p class=defnewpar>Furthermore, in any map editor you can always use existing maps as a background by adding these maps as other data layers to the window, see <a href="how_to_add_extra_layers_to_a_map_window.htm">How to add extra layers to a map window</a>. </p>

<p class=defnewpar>When you wish to create polygons later on, you have to make sure that all segments are properly connected to each other by nodes. This means that during digitizing and/or editing, you must to use snap and split for the beginnings and the ends of all segments that are supposed to be connected to each other.</p>

<p class=kopje>To start the segment editor:</p>

<p>The segment editor is automatically started when you create a new segment map. </p>

<p class=defnewpar>To edit an existing segment map, display the segment map in a map window, open the <a href="map_window_menu_commands.htm">Edit menu</a>, choose <span class=arial><a href="../ilwismen/edit_layer.htm">Edit Layer</a></span>, and select the segment layer from the cascading menu. You can also click a segment map with the right mouse button in a Catalog and choose <span class=arial>Edit</span> from the <a href="..//ilwis/popup/context_sensitive_menu_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >context-sensitive menu</a>. For other methods, see <a href="../ilwis/how_to_edit_point_segment_polygon_and_raster_maps.htm">How to edit point, segment, polygon, and raster maps</a>. </p>

<p class=defnewpar><a href="..//ilwis/popup/object_dependent_data_objects_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Dependent</a> segment maps cannot be edited: first break the dependency links in the <a href="../ilwismen/segment_map_properties.htm">Segment Map's Properties</a> sheet. </p>

<p class=defnewpar>When the segment editor is opened, it starts in Select mode; the mouse pointer appears as a hand. </p>

<h2 id="segeddigitizer">Working with the digitizer</h2>

<p>Make sure that the digitizer is properly set up (<a href="../ilwismen/digitizer_setup_digitizer_select_port.htm">Setup Digitizer wizard</a>) and that the analog map is properly referenced on the digitizer tablet (<a href="../ilwismen/digitizer_map_referencing_coordsys.htm">Map Reference</a>). The <span class=arial>Setup Digitizer</span> and the <span class=arial>Map Reference</span> commands on the <a href="main_window_menu_commands.htm">File menu</a> of the Main window should both be preceded with a check mark <img src="../images/chkmark.gif" align="bottom" width="7" height="7">. For more information, see also <a href="how_to_set_up_a_digitizer_and_start_digitizing.htm">How to set up a digitizer and start digitizing</a> or <a href="../ilwismen/segment_editor_digitizer.htm">Segment editor : Digitizer</a>. </p>

<p class=defnewpar>When the digitizer is <img src="../images/chkmark.gif" align="bottom" width="7" height="7"> <a href="..//ilwismen/popup/segment_editor_file_digitizer_active_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Active</a> in the segment editor, a small, floating window will appear: the digitizer menu (see Figure 1). The digitizer menu contains the commands that will be performed when pressing the buttons on the digitizer cursor. The numbers in front of the commands on the digitizer menu correspond to the numbers of the buttons of your digitizer cursor. </p>

<p class=defnewpar>When in the description below, it is written that you have to press for instance the <span class=arial>Move Points</span> button, you have to press the button of your digitizer cursor which corresponds with the number in front of the <span class=arial>Move Points</span> option on the digitizer menu. In this example, this is the digitizer button corresponding with 3: </p>

<p class=kopje>Zooming/Changing the window:</p>

<p>During digitizing, it is very important that you <a href="..//ilwis/popup/zoom_in_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >zoom in</a> on the part on which you are currently working to ensure proper snapping and splitting. You can use the <span class=arial><a href="../ilwismen/zoom_in_on_maps.htm">Zoom in</a></span> button in the toolbar of the editor, but you can also zoom in with the digitizer cursor. </p>

<p class=defnewpar>To zoom in with the digitizer buttons:</p>

<ul>

<li>	Press the <span class=arial>Change Window</span> button, and move the cursor to the first corner of the area on which you wish to zoom in;</li>

<li>	Press the <span class=arial>1st Point</span> button, you now see the zoom in box tied to the first point, then move the cursor to the 2nd position of the area you wish to zoom in;</li>

<li>	Press the <span class=arial>2nd Point</span> button. </li>

</ul>

<p class=defnewpar>You can also directly position the digitizer cursor on the first corner of the area of interest, press the <span class=arial>Change Window</span> button, then move the cursor to the second corner of the area of interest, and press the <span class=arial>2nd Point</span> button. </p>

<li>    Click a begin or end node or an intermediate point; <br>
        the selected point and its segment change their color;</li>

        <ul>

        <li>	Move the point to another position;</li>

        <li>	Click again to drop the point.</li>

        </ul>

<p class=emptyline>&nbsp;</p>

<li>    Press and hold down the left mouse button on a node or an intermediate point; <br>
        the selected point and its segment change their color;</li>

        <ul>

        <li>	Move the point to another position;</li>

        <li>	Release the left mouse button to drop the point.</li>

        </ul>

<p class=emptyline>&nbsp;</p>

<li>    To pick up a node to which multiple segments are connected: click the node; <br>
        the node is selected and one segment changes its color;</li>

        <ul>

        <li>	If this is not the segment you wish, do not move the mouse and click again, until the correct segment is selected;</li>

        <li>	Then, move the node to another position.</li>

        <li>	Click again to drop the point.</li>

        </ul>

</ol>

<p class=defnewpar>To <i>snap</i> the selected point to an existing node:</p>

<ul>

<li>	position the selected point on the node to which you wish to snap;</li>

<li>	press and hold down the <b>Shift</b> key and click or release the left mouse button on the node;</li>

<li>	when AutoSnap is active, you can simply click or release the left mouse button on the node.</li>

</ul>

<p class=defnewpar>To <i>split</i> a segment and snap to the selected point to the created node (<i>snap/split</i>):</p>

<ul>

<li>	position the selected point somewhere on a segment;</li>

<li>	press and hold down the <span class=arial><b>Ctrl</b></span><span class=arial> </span>key and click somewhere on the segment;</li>

<li>	a message box asks for confirmation to split the segment to which you wish to snap to. </li>

</ul>

<p class=kopjenoboldnound><u><b>Split/Merge mode</b> to split and merge segments:</u> <img src="../images/ed_split_merge_mode.gif" align=bottom width="22" height="22"></p>

<p>In <a href="../ilwismen/segment_editor_split_merge_mode.htm">Split/Merge</a> mode, the mouse pointer appears as a pair of scissors.</p>

<p class=defnewpar>To split a segment:</p>

<ul>

<li>	Position the mouse pointer at the location in the segment where you wish to split;</li>

<li>	Click the left mouse button;</li>

<li>	A message box asks for confirmation to split the segment.</li>

</ul>

<p class=defnewpar>To merge two segments:</p>

<p>To remove a superfluous node which connects only two segments which have the same code:</p>

<ul>

<li>	Position the mouse pointer at the node; </li>

<li>	Click the left mouse button. </li>

<li>	A message box asks for confirmation to merge the segments.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Other functionality</h2>

<p class=kopjeaftertitlesub>To customize the segment editor:</p>

<p>By choosing <span class=arial><a href="../ilwismen/segment_editor_customize.htm">Customize</a></span> from the <a href="segment_editor_menu_commands.htm">File menu</a> or from the context-sensitive menu, you can specify for instance whether to use <span class=arial>Autosnap</span> or not, the distances that should be used for snapping and tunnelling, and the colors to display your segments. For more information, see <a href="../ilwismen/segment_editor_customize.htm">Segment editor : Customize</a>.</p>

<p class=kopjenoboldnound><u>Save:</u> <img src="../images/save.gif" align=bottom width="22" height="22"></p>

<p>When editing segments in the segment editor, all changes are immediately stored. However, to permanently store changes, you may use the <span class=arial><a href="../ilwismen/segment_editor_save.htm">Save</a></span> button or the <span class=arial><a href="../ilwismen/segment_editor_save.htm">Save</a></span> command on the <a href="../ilwis/segment_editor_menu_commands.htm">File menu</a>. After you used <span class=arial>Save</span>, any changes that you made before using <span class=arial>Save</span>, cannot be undone anymore with the <span class=arial>Undo All Changes</span> button or command. For more information, see <a href="../ilwismen/segment_editor_save.htm">Segment editor : Save</a>. </p>

<p class=kopjenoboldnound><u>To undo all changes:</u> <img src="../images/ed_undo_all.gif" align=bottom width="22" height="22"></p>

<p>When editing segments in the segment editor, all changes are immediately stored. However, you can undo all changes, i.e. restore the segment map until the moment when you last used <span class=arial><a href="../ilwismen/segment_editor_save.htm">Save</a></span>, by choosing <span class=arial><a href="../ilwismen/segment_editor_undo_all_changes.htm">Undo All Changes</a></span> from the <a href="segment_editor_menu_commands.htm">File menu</a>. For more information, see <a href="../ilwismen/segment_editor_undo_all_changes.htm">Segment editor : Undo all changes</a>. </p>

<p class=kopje>Undelete segments:</p>

<p>When segments were accidentally deleted, you can use the <span class=arial><a href="../ilwismen/segment_editor_undelete_segments.htm">Undelete Segments</a></span> command on the <a href="../ilwis/segment_editor_menu_commands.htm">Edit menu</a> to selectively recover deleted segments. For more information, see <a href="../ilwismen/segment_editor_undelete_segments.htm">Segment editor : Undelete segments</a>. </p>

<p class=kopje>Find undefineds:</p>

<p>When you wish to check whether all segments have a valid class name, ID or value, you can use the <span class=arial><a href="../ilwismen/segment_editor_find_undefineds.htm">Find Undefineds</span></a> command on the <a href="../ilwis/segment_editor_menu_commands.htm">Edit menu</a>. By using <span class=arial>Find Undefineds</span>, all undefined segments will appear in a special color, so that you can manually assign a proper class name, ID or value to the segments. For more information, see <a href="../ilwismen/segment_editor_find_undefineds.htm">Segment editor : Find undefineds</a>. </p>

<p class=kopje>To extend or reduce the coordinate boundaries of the map:</p>

<p>While you are in the segment editor, you can extend the map's <a href="..//ilwis/popup/coordinate_boundary_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >coordinate boundaries</a> or reduce the map's coordinate boundaries. This will affect the area in which coordinates can be entered into the map. For more information, see <a href="../ilwismen/segment_editor_bounds_of_map.htm">Boundaries of map</a>. </p>

<p class=kopje>To check segments:</p>

<p>To check whether segments are correctly digitized, choose <span class=arial><a href="../ilwismen/segment_editor_check_segments.htm">Check Segments</a></span> from the <a href="segment_editor_menu_commands.htm">File menu</a>. For regular polygonization, you can perform a check on <span class=arial>Self Overlap</span>, <span class=arial>Dead Ends</span>, and <span class=arial>Intersections</span>. Furthermore, for contour lines, you can perform the <span class=arial>Code Consistency</span> check; and for imported segments where each segment encloses a full future polygon, you can perform the <span class=arial>Closed Segments</span> check.</p>

<p class=kopje>To polygonize segments:</p>

<p>To polygonize segments, choose <span class=arial><a href="../ilwismen/segment_editor_polygonize.htm">Polygonize</a></span> from the <a href="segment_editor_menu_commands.htm">File menu</a>. During regular polygonization, topology is created. You can polygonize the entire segment map or a selection of segments in the current segment map. You can create different polygon maps from one segment map, by using a mask. </p>

<p class=defnewpar>When you polygonize, a check on Self Overlap, Intersections and Dead Ends is automatically performed before the map is polygonized. If there are errors in the segments, the operation is aborted and the errors must first be corrected. After correction the operation can be restarted. It is therefore advised to check segments before polygonization; in case errors are found, you have to correct these. </p>

<p class=defnewpar>When during polygonization you created a <a href="..//ilwis/popup/object_dependent_data_objects_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >dependent</a> polygon map, and you have changed or updated the original segment map in the mean time, you can easily update the dependent polygon map by clicking the <span class=arial>Make Up-to-Date</span> button in the <a href="../ilwismen/polygon_map_properties.htm">Polygon Map Properties</a> sheet. </p>

<p class=defnewpar>In case you imported segments of which each segment encloses a full future polygon, you can use the non-topological polygonization method. </p>

<p class=kopje>To remove redundant nodes:</p>

<p>To remove nodes which connect 2 segments only, regardless of segment codes, choose <span class=arial><a href="../ilwismen/segment_editor_remove_redundant_nodes.htm">Remove Redundant Nodes</a></span> from the File menu. This option can for instance be used to reduce the number of segments after importing a segment map from another package, to speed up polygonization, and to improve complex line drawing.</p>

<p>The option combines the 2 segments around a found redundant node into a new segment and this new segment obtains the code of the segment encountered first. It is advised to make a backup of your segment map before performing this command. </p>

<p class=kopje>To pack segments:</p>

<p>To permanently remove segments from a segment map, when you have marked some segments for deletion, choose <span class=arial><a href="../ilwismen/segment_editor_pack.htm">Pack</a></span> from the File menu.</p>

<p class=kopje>To exit the segment editor:</p>

<p>To exit the segment editor, choose the <span class=arial>Exit Editor</span> command on the <span class=arial>File</span> menu or from the context-sensitive menu. You can also click the <span class=arial>Exit editor</span> button in the toolbar. In these cases, the editor is closed but the map(s) remain displayed in a map window. </p>

<p>When you double-click the <span class=arial>Close</span> button or the <a href="..//ilwis/popup/win_controlmenubox_popup.htm" onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')" >Control-menu box</a>, the map and the editor are closed. </p>

<p class=defnewpar>All changes that you make in the polygon map are continuously stored.</p>
