<p class=popuptitle>Definition of dependent data objects</p>

<p class=linespacing03after>The definition of a <a href="object_dependent_data_objects_popup.htm">dependent data object</a>, which is the result of a calculation or another operation, stores the complete expression by which the dependent data object was created. The definition thus defines how a dependent map, table or column was created. The definition of a dependent data object is shown in the <a href="object_properties_popup.htm">properties</a> of an object. </p>

<p class=linespacing03after>A dependent data object can easily be recalculated when it is not up-to-date anymore when input data have changed; ILWIS can simply execute the definition again. When the definition is a MapCalc or TabCalc formula, you can even change the expression itself. </p>

<p class=linespacing03after>The definition of dependent maps and tables is stored in the map's or table's <a href="object_definition_files_popup.htm">object definition file</a>. In principle, only the object definition files are stored on disk; data files are calculated when a dependent map or table is displayed. For dependent columns, the definition is stored in the object definition file of the table to which the column belongs.</p>
