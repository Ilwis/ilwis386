<p class=popuptitle>Coplanar tiepoints in a georef direct linear</p>

<p class=linespacing03after>You may have a problem with coplanar tiepoints when you use a georeference direct linear and during <a href="../../ilwis/popup/screen_digitizing_popup.htm">screen digitizing</a> you notice a shift between the location of the segments or points which you were digitizing and the location where these digitized segments and points are appearing in the photo on the screen.</p>

<p>In a georef direct linear, at least 2 tiepoints should clearly deviate in Z-direction from a (tilted) plane that can be fit by means of a least squares approximation through the active tiepoints. </p>
