<p class=popuptitle>Sample statistics</p>

<p>The following sample statistics are calculated per band, for training pixels in a selected class:</p>

<ul>

<li>	mean,</li>

<li>	standard deviation,</li>

<li>	number of training pixels with the predominant value,</li>

<li>	predominant value,</li>

<li>	total number of training pixels of this class.</li>

</ul>

<p class=linespacing03before>The same is calculated for the current set of selected pixels; this is displayed in the Lower half of the Sample Statistics window. </p>

<p class=linespacing03before>The first map in the map list is represented by Band 1, the second by Band 2, etc. Based on the sample statistics, you may decide to sample more training pixels of a certain class, merge classes, delete classes, etc.</p>
