<p class=popuptitle>View Angle</p>

<p>The View Angle is an angle in degrees which defines the aperture of your view, i.e. how much you can see of your 3D model. </p>

<ul>

<li>	When the view angle is small, only a small area of the total 3D view is observed, with the <a href="../../ilwismen/popup/georef3d_editor_view_point_popup.htm">view point</a> as the middle of the observed area. </li>

<li>	The larger the angle, the larger the area that is observed. </li>

<li>	A maximum of 180° is allowed.</li>

</ul>
