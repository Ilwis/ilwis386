<p class=defnewpar>Type a value for the number of colors that should be used for values or percentages in between two limits.</p>

<p class=defnewpar>When you use stretch for the values or percentages in between two limits, the values or percentages in between these two limits are shown with a number of gradual colors that range from the color of the lower limit to the color of the upper limit. </p>

<p class=diabox>Type a value for the number of colors that should be used for values/percentages in between two limits in case of stretching. <br>
When you select a large value, the more gradual colors will change from one limit into the other. The maximum number of colors between to limits is 30.<br>
When you type a small value, you can simulate a kind of 'classification'.</p>

<p class=diabox>The color step value applies for all values in between limits that are stretched.</p>

<p class=defnewpar>The color bar at the bottom of the representation editor shows the colors of the entire representation.</p>

<p class=kopje>Additional information:</p>

<p>For the colors in between two limits (or break points), there are three possiblities:</p>

<ul>

<li>	values in between two limits are stretched between the colors of the upper and lower limit (<b>Stretch</b>), or</li>

<li>	values in between two limits get the same color as the upper limit (<b>Upper</b>), or</li>

<li>	values in between two limits get the same color as the lower limit (<b>Lower</b>).</li>

</ul>

<p class=defnewpar>To edit the colors of values in between two limits:</p>

<ul>

<li>	double-click on the words <b>Stretch</b>, <b>Upper</b>, <b>Lower</b> that appear in between two limits in the representation editor window, or. </li>

<li>	select one of the words <b>Stretch</b>, <b>Upper</b>, <b>Lower</b> as they appear in between two limits in the representation editor window and press the Enter key.</li>

</ul>

<p>When the color method in between limits was <b>Stretch</b>, then <b>Upper</b> is assigned; </p>

<p>when it was <b>Upper</b>, then <b>Lower</b> is assigned; </p>

<p>when it was <b>Lower</b>, then <b>Stretch</b> is assigned. This is a cyclic choice.</p>

<p class=kopje>Hardware limitation:</p>

<p>Mind that in total only 256 colors are available. It is therefore advised not to use a large value for the color steps, especially when you use many stretch ranges.</p>
